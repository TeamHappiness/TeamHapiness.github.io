				<p>Happynest is a gratitude journal app that helps you and your friends, family, and co-workers be happier and appreciate each other! Psychology research shows that if you get into the habit of writing once a week about what you're grateful for, you will feel happier and healthier.</p>
				<p>Sign up with a group, or what we call a nest, of close friends or family who want to do this happiness challenge with you. Then go forth and write! Once you complete your challenge for the week, you can see everyone else's entries. Goal is to get everyone in the nest to write at least once a week. Tap on your pal to nudge them to post that week.</p>
				<p>Be happy!</p>
